# üê∂ Dog Breed Identification

This project is a deep learning-based solution for identifying dog breeds from images. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images into predefined dog breed categories.

## Features

- Upload an image of a dog and identify its breed.
- Trained on the popular [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).
- Built using Python, TensorFlow/Keras.
- Achieves high accuracy using transfer learning.
- Includes model training, evaluation, and inference scripts.
